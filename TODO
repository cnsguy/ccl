cmake:
  - hardcoding a check for -O2 in the benchmark doesn't seem like the proper solution

general:
  - document stuff:
    - especially that value_copy_fn / key_copy_fns need to be written in a way as to not change the original ptr's values if it's going to return an error

  - test alloc fail paths
  - rewrite tests / benchmark with actual C unit test / benchmark tools

array:
  - optionally generate _append, _insert, _insert_no_bound_check variants which take value pointers
  - allow overriding capacity grow logic + test w/ overridden capacity grow logic
  - test pointer _append, _insert, _insert_no_bound_check variants

hashmap:
  - optionally generate _insert variants which take value or key pointers
  - test w/ overridden capacity grow / shrink logic, grow / shrink thresholds
  - test pointer _insert variants

string:
  - optimize instead of this placeholder impl
  - utf8 variant which handles character pops / etc correctly
  - utf8_char type
  - small string optimization
  - string append functions which take other strings, etc

hash functions:
  - should have a more uniform interface?
  - seeds are currently hardcoded - should have a fallback default and a ccl_hash_init_seed() function which changes that variable
